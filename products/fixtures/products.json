It lights up with tonic and makes what we consider, humbly, to be the worlds greatest negroni, but leave it alone with an ice cube for a truly remarkable experience.",

The Ciroc brand breaks the mould and is one of the only brands in the world to make their Vodka from fine French grapes, instead of using the typical grain. The bottle design reflects this heritage, featuring a cockerel perched on a cluster of grapes to symbolise the Gaillac region where the French grapes originate from. Five-time distilled Ciroc Ultra-Premium Vodka has a fresh, citrus taste with a silky texture, a perfect base for delicious drinks. A great way to celebrate with an elegant touch of French glamour.",

Lagavulin 9 Year Old is a roaring single malt that leaves an intensely smoky flavour in every sip. The golden liquid recalls the Lannisters’ riches and comes from being exclusively matured in first fill ex-Bourbon casks. The nose is characteristic of Lagavulin and bursts with sweet smoke, with a slightly zestier, maritime scent than other expressions. On the palate it opens with smoky, caramelised banana, burnt marshmallow and vanilla, fading into a salted caramel finish.",

The name ‘monkey shoulder’ refers to a condition that some maltmen used to develop while working long shifts turning barley. Gruelling, repetitive shovelling sometimes caused an arm to hang down like a monkey – thus the nickname. Although the maltmen at Monkey Shoulder HQ are among the few who still turn barley by hand, working conditions have fortunately changed so the injury has been consigned to the past. Today, Monkey Shoulder lives on as an affectionate tribute to honour the hard graft of maltmen past and present. A masterful, unique ‘triple malt’ created by Malt Master David Stewart, Monkey Shoulder is mellow enough to be enjoyed straight, or it can be used to add class to an array of cocktails – just don’t tell the maltmen!",
